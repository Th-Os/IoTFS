- Implementing Adapter
    - using callback or async to get result
    - add errors
    - write tests for queries.py
        - for this a fs adapter will be needed
- Implementing Connector
    - implement listener (inotify or directly in fs.py code?)
    - implement reader (simple read api)
- Drawing hourglass model for iotfs
- Package IoTFS and devide main code and add-ons (adapter/mqtt, adapter/fs)
- FS functions to implement (ordered by importance from bottom to top):
    - removexattr
    - listxattr
    - setxattr
    - getxattr
    - fsyncdir
    - fsync
    - flush
    - readlink
    - link
    - symlink
    - access
    - mknod
    - Whole permission / mode handling
- FS utility nodelist implementation
- FS test functions:
    - mode (create, read, write, access) methods: create, mknode, mkdir, access
    - rename
    - link
    - flush
- Github Actions:
    - new workflows or jobs for input and output of hourglass model -> package iotfs, execute "other" code outside of it



Errors:
- assert is_file in mqtt_test test_msg is sometimes failing.
- assert is_dir in mqtt_test test_topic is sometimes failing.
