    - add errors
    - write tests for queries.py
- Implementing Connector
    - test listener
- Drawing hourglass model for corefs
- FS functions to implement (ordered by importance from bottom to top):
    - removexattr
    - listxattr
    - setxattr
    - getxattr
    - fsyncdir
    - fsync
    - flush -> Needs Implementing
    - readlink -> Implementing
    - link -> Implementing
    - symlink -> Implementing
    - access -> Testing
    - mknod -> Testing
    - Whole permission / mode handling -> Testing
- FS time attributes could need updating, when specific events arise
- FS test functions:
    - mode (create, read, write, access) methods: create, mknode, mkdir, access
    - rename
    - link
    - flush



Errors:
- assert is_file in mqtt_test test_msg is sometimes failing.
- assert is_dir in mqtt_test test_topic is sometimes failing.
- 22 Readdir calls at the beginning of each session. -> listening process is disturbed
