- Implementing Adapter
    - add errors
    - write tests for queries.py
- Implementing Connector
    - test listener
- Drawing hourglass model for corefs
- FS functions to implement (ordered by importance from bottom to top):
    - removexattr
    - listxattr
    - fsyncdir
    - fsync
    - flush -> Needs Implementing
    - Whole permission / mode handling -> Testing
- FS time attributes could need updating, when specific events arise
- FS test functions:
    - mode (create, read, write, access) methods: create, mknod, mkdir, access
    - flush



Errors:
- 22 Readdir calls at the beginning of each session. -> listening process is disturbed
- rmdir not working correctly: 2 x fs_test


Implementing Links

2 Variants:

- Extend nodes
- Implement "entries" that connect to inode

Differences of Links:

Symbolic:
    - no data in file
    - points to another entry
    - can point to file in another fs or even directories

Hardlink:
    - data in file
    - another representation of a file linked to same inode
    - can only point to file in filesystem
